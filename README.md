# SCC_ML_Task
# SmokeDetection
Summary of the project - 

A machine learning algorithm was developed to predict the probability of a smoke alarm going off based on certain conditions. The algorithm was trained using a decision tree model and the Sklearn library in Python was used for training. The decision tree is a popular algorithm in machine learning and is used to make decisions by recursively splitting the data into smaller subsets based on the most significant attributes. With this algorithm, the goal is to accurately predict the probability of a smoke alarm going off in a given situation to improve safety measures.
